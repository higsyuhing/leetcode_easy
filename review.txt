1. math is important: 
  many problem can be solved by a smart mathematical approach
  like the problem calculate "single" element with using XOR calculation
  bitwise operation. 

2. basic data structure/algorithm is important
  especially the core idea inside of it

3. the tricky idea for particular problem
  this is so damn smart!!!

4. python coding style //in standard solution, in "high level" usage
